# abstract

In the fast-evolving digital world, there is a need for cybersecurity studies to equip professionals to fight increasingly complex cyber threats. This study conducts a methodical analysis of diverse cybersecurity programs to align them with industry needs defined by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) and its European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF). Using the Cybersecurity Higher Education Database (CYBERHEAD), we apply Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and vectorization to transform text descriptions of programs into quantitative forms, then reduce them through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). These program descriptions are clustered into 12 skill roles under the ECSF using K-means clustering.

From our experiments, study programs show distinct distributions across these clusters, and NMF performs slightly better than SVD based on Silhouette Scores and Davies-Bouldin Index. Top keywords for each cluster give a view of the main themes and topics on which our research has focused. The study illustrates how integrated TF-IDF, dimensionality reduction, and clustering techniques can be used in optimizing cybersecurity education according to the demands in the market.
